* REFLEXRUN
CREATED BY QUARTZ AND ZEV

** HOW TO GET STARTED
*** Installing the HUD/Mode
To /“install”/ Reflexrun, put the whole “reflexrun” folder into the Reflex “ui” folder.
Which you can find here: *Reflexfps -> base -> internal -> ui*

*** Installing the Maps
Copy the maps included in the pack (and future RRmaps) into the Reflex Maps folder.
Which you can find here: *Reflexfps -> Base -> internal - > Maps*

*** Play Reflexrun!
If you want to record / practice locally you can do so by typing ~map RRmapname~
